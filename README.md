# Exploration of Internet Routing using GNS3

**Exploration of Internet Routing using GNS3** is a research and simulation-based project that investigates the behaviour, performance, and design principles of major Internet routing protocols—**RIP**, **OSPF**, and **EIGRP**—through hands-on experimentation.

Leveraging **GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator-3)** and **FRRouting (FRR)**, we created small-scale virtual networks and observed protocol behaviour using tools like **Wireshark**. Through carefully crafted experiments, we analysed **routing convergence**, **efficiency**, and **scalability** under various conditions, such as link failures and changes in link cost.

##  Project Objectives

1. Compare the functionality and characteristics of **RIP**, **OSPF**, and **EIGRP** across topologies  
2. Measure and analyse **convergence time**, **efficiency**, and **protocol overhead**  
3. Explore strengths, weaknesses, and suitable use-cases for each protocol  
4. Gain hands-on experience with **GNS3**, **FRRouting**, and **Wireshark** for network simulation and diagnostics

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented multiple simulated topologies to test protocol behaviour  
- Used **graph theory** concepts and algorithms like **Dijkstra’s**, **Bellman-Ford**, and **Diffusing Update Algorithm** to inform theoretical background  
- Visualised protocol message exchange using **Wireshark packet capture**  
- Simulated **failure scenarios** to observe protocol robustness and adaptability

This project bridged theoretical networking knowledge with practical, scenario-driven insights—building core competencies in network design, troubleshooting, and routing architecture evaluation.
